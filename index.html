        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
        <p>
          Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that can be played by two players. The
          game is played on a 3x3 grid, with each player taking turns placing
          their symbol (usually X or O) in an empty space on the board. The goal
          of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either
          horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.
        </p>

          <h3>How to play:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The first player places their symbol in an empty space on the
              board.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second player then takes their turn and places their symbol in
              an empty space on the board.
            </li>
            <li>
              Players continue taking turns until one player gets three of their
              symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
            </li>
            <li>
              If neither player has won and there are no more empty spaces on
              the board, the game ends in a tie.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I have made the game more challenging by increasing the size of the
            board on different levels to require four or five in a row to winüòä.
